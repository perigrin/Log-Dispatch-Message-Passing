NAME
    Log::Dispatch::Message::Passing - log events to Message::Passing

SYNOPSIS
    In your application code:

      use Log::Dispatch;
      use Log::Dispatch::Message::Passing;
      use Message::Passing::DSL;

      my $log = Log::Dispatch->new;

      $log->add(Log::Dispatch::Message::Passing->new(
            name      => 'myapp_aggregate_log',
            min_level => 'debug',
            output    => log_chain {
                output zmq => (
                    class => 'ZeroMQ',
                    connect => 'tcp://192.168.0.1:5558',
                );
            },
      ));

      $log->warn($_) for qw/ foo bar baz /;

    On your central log server:

      message-pass --input ZeroMQ --input_options '{"socket_bind":"tcp://*:5558"}' --output File --output_options '{"filename":"myapp_aggregate.log"}'

DESCRIPTION
    This provides a Log::Dispatch log output system that sends logged events
    to Message::Passing.

    This allows you to use any of the Message::Passing emitters or filters
    to process log events and send them across the network, and you can use
    the toolkit to trivially construct a log aggregator.

METHODS
  "new"
     my $table_log = Log::Dispatch::Message::Passing->new(\%arg);

    This method constructs a new Log::Dispatch::Message::Passing output
    object.

    Required arguments are:

      output - a L<Message::Passing> L<Output|Message::Passing::Role::Output> class.

  log_message
    This is the method which performs the actual logging, as detailed by
    Log::Dispatch::Output.

SEE ALSO
    Message::Passing
        The logging framework itself, allowing you to very simply build log
        aggregation and processing servers.

    Message::Passing::Output::ZeroMQ
        The recommended network protocol for aggregating or transporting
        messages across the network.

        Note that whilst this transport is recommended, it is NOT required
        by this module, so you need to require (and depend on)
        Message::Passing::ZeroMQ separately.
